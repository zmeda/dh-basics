# DH basics (Multishot - Unhallowed Essence)

## CDR

With Yawn in cube you want to have Vengeance always up (why is this important? V. gives you dmg boost, dmg reduction and gives you hatred per second). Yawn gives you 65% CRD on Venegeance. So we need additional ~36.5 (rather a % or two more if you can - just to make sure it is always up).

Must haves (not hard to get):
- Paragon points: 10%
- Gem in helm: 12.5%
- Shoulders: 8%

Optional (harder to get):
- Bow: 8% (not optimal)
- Dead Men's Legacy: 8%
- Jewelry: 8%
- Gloves: 8%

How to calculate CDR?
```
CDR = 1 - ((1 - CDR on item) * (1 - CDR on item) * ...)
```

Let's take an example of must haves and DML 8%:
```
CDR = 1 - ((1 - 0,1) * (1 - 0,125) * (1 - 0,08) * (1 - 0,08)) = 1 - (0,9 * 0,875 * 0,92 * 0,92) = 1 - 0,66654 = 33.35%
```
This shows that just with must haves and DML there is still not enough CDR. SO we need another peice. And note that all previous calculations are made on perfect rolls.

## Discipline

You want to maximize the disciplne on all items (where if possible ofc): bow, quiver, cloak (torso).
One of the important skills around discipline is Preparation with Invigoration rune which gives you 20 more discipline. Max possible discipline (with perfect rolls) is: 30 (initial) + 20 (Prep. skill) + 12 (bow) + 12 (quiver) + 12 (cloak) = 86 (without SoJ - Stone of Jordan). SoJ gives you up to 12 more but then you can not wear Focus + Restraint. SoJ is good for speed builds where you do not need to fully maximize DMG.

## Attack speed (AS)

You want to miximize attack speed. This is APS (Attacks per second) table: https://imgur.com/n9ML9GU . Just check in your stats at what APS are you right now and then decide if you need to reroll something to AS.

## Area DMG

This is very end game stat. Do not bother rerolling to it

# What to reroll in your case

## Shoulders

They are not that good. Nevertheless reroll Rain of Vengeance skill to 8% CDR. Perfect rolls would be: DEX, VIT, ALL RES, 8% CDR

## Helm

For now it is ok. Once you are not that squishy anymore you want to reroll VIT to 6% CHC (Critical Hit Chance). Perfect rolls: DEX, 6% CHC, 15% MS

## Gloves

Reroll Armor to CHD (Critical Hit Damage). perfect rolls: DEX, 7% AS (or 8% CDR), 10% CHC, 50% CHD

## Torso

You have near to perfect torso. You did reroll correctly! No changes needed.

## Legs

Legs are ok.

## Boots

Rerool movement speed to 15% MS. Perfect rools: DEX, VIT, ALL RES, 15% MS

## Bow

Yang's Recurve. Yours is ok-ish. Reroll secondary (Moster kill +) to 12 discipline. Perfect rolls: DEX, 10% DMG, 7% AS, Cost reduction 50%, Legendary power should be as close as possible to 200%

## Quiver

DML. Not that good since it does not have discipline. Perfect rolls: DEX, 20% AS, 10% CHC, 8% CDR, 12 discipline, Legendary power should be as close as possible to 200%

## Wrists

Reaper's Wraps or Nemesis - depends on the squishiness. Perfect rolls: DEX, VIT, 6% CHC, 20% Fire DMG

## Belt

The Witching Hour. Reroll ALL RES to VIT. Perfect rolls: DEX, VIT, 7% AS, 50% CHD

## Amulet

Hellfire Amulet. Here you want another passive. The best are one of the following: Thrill of the Hunt, Cull the Weak, Awareness. Those 3 are used in most of the MS builds (awareness not in every tho). Yours is not that great tho. Perfect rolls: 20% Fire DMG, 10% CHC, 100% CHD, Socket

## Rings

Focus + Restraint. Both should have 6% CHC, 50% CHD, on one you would prefer 8% CDR and on the other one depends on your current AS. If adding 7% more AS will bring you to the next APS breakpoint do it. Otherwise take DEX or DMG.
